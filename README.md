Association Rules
Association rules are used to discover interesting relationships or patterns between items in large datasets. These rules are often used in Market Basket Analysis to identify products that frequently co-occur in transactions. An association rule is typically expressed in the form {𝐴}→{𝐵}, meaning that if item 𝐴 is purchased, item 𝐵 is likely to be purchased as well.
